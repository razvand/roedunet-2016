In this work we have developed an interactive tool that can explore the depths of the linking process. Every requirement was met and surpassed, the project offering more than it was asked for. It can inspect both 32-{}bit and 64-{}bit ELFs, it can analyse the contents of these files and create links between matching data, it can disassemble every relevant function and it offers a full functional graphical interface that allows the user to interact easily with the program.

The tests we conducted varied from basic user interaction to numerical data, and all the test results led to a positive outcome. ELF Detective works correctly, provides complete data, is very interactive and scales well. Another quality that came out of the beta testing phase was that the project is eye-{}candy, it feels great and looks user friendly. 

Our next plan for this project is to extend it with support for more binary file format, more platforms and usable on more operating systems. Due to its modularity, this can be done easily by targeting specific environments.
