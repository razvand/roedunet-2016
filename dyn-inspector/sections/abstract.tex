Dynamic linking and loading are some of the most obscure processes which happen when an executable is run. However, tracing them by means of debuggers is a complex task which is not suitable for inexperienced users. We present DynInspector, an interactive inspection tool with a user-friendly graphical user interface, that eases the understanding of dynamic linking and loading. DynInspector offers support for viewing relevant areas of the program memory by making use of the existing functionality of debuggers. DynInspector is to be used by Computer Science students and hobbyists to gain a better understanding on the subject of dynamic linking and loading and support the teaching of tehnical topics.
